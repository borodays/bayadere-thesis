        <p>I first encountered <i>La Bayadère</i> as an 11-year-old ballet student performing the Kingdom of the Shades scene at a summer program. My whiteness, and the predominant whiteness of the studio I grew up in, enabled me to grow up with the ballet as an object of fantasy, admiration, and ambition. From my first encounter with it, Nikiya — the main character — was a dream role of mine. Like several of the dancers whose voices are displayed here, I was drawn to the emotional complexity of the role and the beauty of the movement. Only later, when I began to develop my own political consciousness, did I see the other aspects of the ballet — the racism, the European aristocratic values it upholds, the wildly different choice of choreography for "noble" characters as opposed to subordinate ones. It was this tension, between a long history of emotional attachment to the ballet and a strong sense of revulsion at its form and content, that led me to this project. As even this most conservative of art forms began to respond, slowly and painfully, to the anti-racist demands of the protests in Summer 2020, the problem of <i>La Bayadère</i> seemed still more urgent. I do not undertake this project to absolve myself of my attachment to a ballet so at odds with my values, but neither do I want to simply dismiss it as a self-evidently racist and unperformable work (though my personal feelings do tend in that direction). The mere fact of its continued persistence in the face of growing opposition warrants a deeper investigation, and criticism of the ballet cannot proceed without acknowledgment of its aesthetic and affective power. This power must be acknowledged and taken on, because it is precisely this power that artistic directors and choreographers use to justify the ballet even as it becomes increasingly impossible to defend its values.</p>
