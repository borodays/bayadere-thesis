                    <blockquote>
                        Possibly, the continued relevance of this ballet lies in the central heroine’s modern character. Unlike Giselle, whose fate is defined more by love and self-sacrifice than by bitterness and resentment, Nikiya’s spirit does not find peace until Solor’s death allows the lovers to reunite in eternity. <div class = "emphasisQuote">It is precisely these characteristics that Nikiya inherited from the self-confident Sacountala and from several [Western representations of] heavenly Indian courtesans or apsars.</div> Petipa’s bayadère remains faithful and ardent, but, in contrast to the tragic heroines of the Romantic period, who meekly forgive their lovers’ betrayals, Nikiya bears the traits of a more modern and decisive woman. At the end of the ballet she is ruthless to both her beloved and her enemies.

                    <blockquote>And another [reviewer] complains that while the dance of Europe is "insufferably tedious," the body cold and constrained, the head moving with mechanical precision, and the mouth wearing the eternal smile, the bayadères "dance with their whole frame. Their heads dance, their arms dance – their eyes, above all, obey the <b>movement</b> and <b>fury</b> of the dance. For them each dance is a poem" (Morning Post 3 October 1838). In other words, the dancers are not only different from the Western ballerina, but they are superior—their dancing replaces Taglioni’s as the poetry of motion and, in accordance with the laws of romantic unity, every portion of their body undulates to the same idea.</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>Orientalism also shows up in classical dances quite a lot as a device that allowed expression of Western ideas of magic, sexuality, and fantasy that might otherwise have been taboo in traditional Western settings.</blockquote>
