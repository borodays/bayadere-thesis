'She did exist,' albeit misrepresented and nearly erased from history. When a European impresario brought the South Indian devadasis (temple dancers) to Europe in 1843 [sic], they inspired a lot of publicity. But the British social-reform movement in India banished them, and degraded them as prostitutes. That stereotype still exists."</blockquote>

                        [17th-century French traveller François] Bernier wrote in his widely read journal  … that the brahman priests of the Jagannath temple ‘raped’ the young dancers after they were ‘married’ to the god: <p id = "innerQuote"><i>These knaves select a beautiful young maiden to become … the bride of Jagannat, who accompanies the god to the temple with all the pomp and ceremony which I have noticed, where she remains the whole night, having been made to believe that Jagannat will come and lie with her … In the night one of these impostors enters the temple through a small back door, enjoys the unsuspecting damsel, [and] makes her believe whatever may be deemed necessary …</i></p> This depiction of the priests as evil, lustful characters and the dancing girls as their erotic victims would be repeated many times in travel literature. It also became a common theme of several eighteenth- and nineteenth-century plays, operas and ballets. <br>

                        The oriental bayadère ... is not of the supernatural world but the material, caught and enslaved, a condition accentuated by her wrists, ankles, and neck being laden with jewelry. But because she is an idea of the Orient, unattainable in the West, she too fanned fugitive desires in audiences. The sylph incarnates unfulfilled desire, the bayadère temporary possession, with both, despite their difference, functioning as icons of romanticism. <br>

                        For me, this delicate negotiation was important to keep the historical footprint of the temple dancer alive. It is important because the temple dancer was not an imperial orientalist fantasy. She was real. The dancing girls or courtesans in India were variously known as devadasi, tawaif, baiji, kanchini, and nautch. We read about them from British colonial travelogues and Indian court records.<br>
