    <h1>Conclusions: Some Thoughts on Authenticity and the Future</h1>
    <div class = "mx-auto" id = "conclusions">
        <p>In a famous thought experiment first attested by Plutarch, philosophers were asked to consider whether the ship in which the hero Theseus had once sailed, now so old that every one of its planks had rotted and been replaced one by one, remained Theseus' ship — that is, whether the essence of the ship lay in the original planks that had made it up, or in the overall shape those planks formed. This question of authenticity, what it is, and how (or whether) it should be preserved, plagues any artifact that survives long enough to become famous — or infamous. Ballets are no different. As we have seen, there are as many versions of <i>La Bayadère</i> as there are dancers, and as many critiques as there are commenters. We have also seen, however, the preoccupation with authenticity or accuracy, even among those who recognize the inauthenticity of the ballet's inspirations. Such tensions are ubiquitious: Lopatkina, the dancer, avows she cannot imagine what emotions a real-life Nikiya might feel, then proceeds to imagine them and draw them forth; Corella, the artistic director, declares the ballet to be a fairy tale even as he consults Chakravorty on authentic Indian steps; even Fuhrer, the critic, in one sentence acknowledges the ballet's "awkwardly racist" world and in the next declares that gifted dancers might convince the audience their characters "might be real people." <br> 
        <br>Shobhana Jeyasingh, whose words and works have been present throughout this exhibit, articulated some of what might be behind that tension: "I think it's very Oriental. And the Oriental is different to the Indian." <i>La Bayadère</i> is a work of fantasy, whose referent is itself, or perhaps the imaginations of those who created it. Its history has shown that one can add, change, or entirely remove whole sections of the ballet, perform only fragments, or make entirely new works, and yet, in some mysterious way, <i>La Bayadère</i> remains clearly recognizable. Perhaps, then, the question of what makes it <i>La Bayadère</i>  — form or content, structure or planks  — has a much simpler answer. The ghostly traces of Theseus' words and deeds adhere to the ship declared to be his not because of some power of the ship, but because of the imaginations willing to place them there. The essence of <i>La Bayadère</i>, too, is something more than either its specific dances or its plotline. It is the history it contains, the choices companies and dancers make to perform it, the commentary written about it, above all the fantasies it inspires. <br> <br>
        In that case, dismantling the harm it perpetuates is not a simple matter of choosing not to perform a particular set of dances in a particular order. As the first network visualization demonstrated, <i>La Bayadère</i> was not the only ballet of its kind. It is also not the only one that survives. Though companies perform few outright Orientalist ballets (though, of course, there are enough to be persistent problems), fragments of purportedly lost ones still survive, as <i>pas de deux</i> or solos performed at competitions and galas. And though the context may be stripped away, the costuming, music, and movement quality hint at the Orientalist meanings lurking behind such decontextualization. <i>La Bayadère</i> is a lightning rod because it survives in full, but it is only one sign that Orientalist fantasies still structure ballet. As we have seen, even in a ballet world tending more and more to the neoclassical, Orientalist ballets allow emotionality, physicality, and character work that other ballets do not. This fantasy persists because ballet reality is, in many ways, unsatisfactory. The task, then, is to make the fantasy obsolete, not only by declining to perform <i>La Bayadère</i> — although that too — but by building better works in its place.
