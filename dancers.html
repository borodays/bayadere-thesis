                        <i>But this is also a ballet that suffers without star power. Its story, set in the awkwardly racist world of Royal India, borders on the ridiculous. Solor, a warrior, finds himself in a love triangle with Nikiya, to whom he’s pledged his love over the sacred fire, and Gamzatti. Gamzatti kills her rival by hiding an asp in a basket of flowers; the grieving Solor has an opium-induced dream of Nikiya in the Kingdom of the Shades. Tormented by continuing visions of Nikiya, Solor nevertheless marries Gamzatti, which causes the temple to collapse as “the vengeance of the gods is unleashed.” Nikiya and Solor are reunited in death. Get that? No? It takes the powerful persuasion of veteran dancers to smooth over the lumps and bumps in this narrative, to transcend its sillier moments and convince us that its characters might be real people. In the Seo-Boylston cast, without a high-wattage star to distract us (Vadim Muntagirov’s elegant but vapid Solor was no help), the weight of this lumbering, overstuffed extravaganza felt terribly heavy.</i>

                        <i>The wall that separated ballet from the real world in my mind began to crumble when I was selected to be a child extra in the Mariinsky's performance of La Bayadère. [...] Somewhere deep in the Hollywood complex of the Kodak Theatre, we learned an angular dance in second position. We hopped around with flexed feet, waived our arms and periodically folded into kowtows. In hindsight, it's obvious that we were performing caricatures of the "Orient." I don't even think it occurred to me that La Bayadère was set in South Asia because everyone was white—until dress rehearsal. [...] They fitted us in dark unitards with hoods to cover everything except our faces. Later, the makeup artist instructed us on how to apply our makeup. She handed each of us a palette of dark brown grease paint, pausing to do a double take after she handed me mine. It wasn't until I received all of the pieces of my costume—a mahogany colored bodysuit, dark brown face paint and bright red lipstick—that I discovered I was to wear blackface.
                        I must have been the only dark-skinned person to have been in a Mariinsky production. The women in charge weren't sure what to do with me. I saw the white dancers around me covering themselves in the brown paint and distinctly remember being at a loss for words because it was so bizarre. It was especially the red lipstick traced around the mouth that disturbed me. I remember looking down at the paints and trying to figure out what they had to do with me. All I could manage to say was, "Do I need this?" I became that thing in the room that no one had ever had to confront. Our chaperones exchanged glances and finally responded with an uncomfortable "Yes." One woman laughed nervously as she indicated that I still had to wear the makeup because my brown skin was many shades lighter than the color of the bodysuit and the paint selected to cover our skin.</i>
