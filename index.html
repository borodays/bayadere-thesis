        <div id = "firstWords">By 1877, </div><p>when Marius Petipa premiered the first version of <i>La Bayadère</i> in St. Petersburg, the word <i>bayadère,</i> from the Portuguese word for "dancer," had firmly established itself in the European imagination, supplanting the Sanskrit <i>devadasi,</i> literally "female servant of a god." This European word, popularized in European travel accounts and popular culture, developed a mystique of its own, conveying something much more than the social and occupational status of temple dancer. The <i>bayadère</i> symbolized devotion, spirituality, sensuality, beauty, self-possession. She also fit easily into European notions of a decadent East where lecherous priests and cruel rulers lurked around each corner, and where strict social norms (studiously detached from Europe's presumably just hierarchies) forced noble heroines into precarious situations. By the time the first real <i>devadasis</i> performed in Europe in 1838, they were judged against this ideal — and often found wanting. The <i>bayadère</i> had a life of her own, and to the Europeans who saw her image in text and on the stage, it did not matter that this life had little in common with the <i>devadasi</i> whose image she had once been derived from.</p>
        <p>For this reason, the question of authenticity and accuracy in <i>La Bayadère</i> has always been fraught. Though Petipa was concerned with conveying the atmosphere of India for his audience, and the libretto for the ballet displays an impressive-sounding range of pseudo-Indian terms and ideas, the choreography for the main cast — Nikiya, the titular temple dancer; Solor, her beloved warrior; and Gamzatti, the Rajah's daughter to whom Solor is betrothed — is, for the most part, purely classical. The plot, too, is almost identical to <i>Giselle</i>, first performed in 1841 and set in medieval Germany: the heroine dies, betrayed by her lover's engagement to another, then reappears to him as a spirit, or shade. Yet the Orientalist framing allows important differences in plot, in choreography, and in tone. Petipa borrowed shreds of Hindu practices and Muslim beliefs, but he took most liberally from his own society's mythologies about a homogenized East. The foundation of this ballet is thoroughly Orientalist, entirely European in manner and outlook. Why, then do so many of the modern conversations about <i>La Bayadère</i> in the ballet world hinge on questions of authenticity? What does it mean to imagine a deeply Orientalist ballet in a modern society? What exactly is the essence of <i>La Bayadère</i>, and can it be compatible with a slowly diversifying ballet world?</p>
        <p>In this digital exhibit, I explore these questions through the many voices that have engaged with them, from ballet dancers to academics to Indian dancers and scholars. As these constituents discuss <i>La Bayadère</i>, they reveal the instability of the object itself. It is, at various times and to various voices sampled here, a transformative work of art, an authentically Orientalist text, an unconscionably racist piece, some uneasy combination of the three, or something else entirely. Its essence is sometimes the purity of its choreography, sometimes a generalized version of its plot, sometimes the specific "Indian" elements without which the ballet would be unrecognizable. This slipperiness is the point. <i>La Bayadère</i> generates more commentary, parody, and reworking now than it ever has before — but the <i>bayadère</i> at the center of all this discourse is as unreal and unreachable as a shade.</i></p>
